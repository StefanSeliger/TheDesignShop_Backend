### What I learned

I worked on this project before but so far it was only frontend based with no connection to an online server or database. So until now it wasn't dynamic. Now I rebuild the project from a backend perspective and conncted the project with a database and made it possible to add new products to the shop. This happens by reading out a from on the addProduct page. 

Display a random range of products on the addProduct page was another challenge and also how to highlight a hero image in the main page product overview. 

Another interesting part was to use Dotenv to hide all sensitive information. As always I very much enjoyed working with SCSS and in this case with partials from EJS. 

### Continued development

The next step will be to upload the project on Heroku. There are still ways to optimize the overall look of the page. E.g. I want to implement a mobile menu and simplify the SCSS code. Another point would be to optimize the functions in the index.js.
